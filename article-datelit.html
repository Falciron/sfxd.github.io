<p>When creating a report or a list view, you sometimes need to filter based on a dynamic value.
Say you want the records of last week for example. In a report, you could do that with the global filter on top of the reporting engine.
But say you want Opportunities closed between the Last month and the Last week ?</p>
<p>Well that's when Date Literals come in.</p>
